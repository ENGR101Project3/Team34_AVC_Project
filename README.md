Open up Geany. Open the server3.cpp file found in the AVC_server folder in Geany. Click the arrow next to the build button, and select 'Set Build Commands'. Replace the command under the label make with mingw32-make.
Open up a separate Geany program. Open up the robot.cpp file found in the ACV_robot folder in that separate Geany program. Click the arrow next to the build button, and select 'Set Build Commands'. Replace the command under the label make with mingw32-make.
Go back to the server3.cpp you have open in Geany. Hit the arrow next to the build command. Hit Make All. Hit the Execute button next to the build button.
Go to the robot.cpp you have open in the other Geany application. Hit the arrow next to the build command. Hit Make All. Hit the Execute button next to the build button.
The robot should now follow the line.
